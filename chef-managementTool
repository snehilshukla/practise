3)So your code would be repeatable,testable and versionable

Advantage Of CM Tool:

5) Prevent error            
6) Reduce cost                      

Type of CM Tool:
1)Push Based Tool
2)Pull Based Tool.

1)Push Based Tool:   The main sever that start communication and send configuration data the nodes,without the nodes asking for it.

Push Configuration tool server         Node1
                                       Node2
                                       Node3

2)Pull Based Tool:   The nodes pull the configuration information from the main serv                     -er.
                     A small s/w(called client) is installed on every node.This clie                     -nt will be:
                         a) At regular interval get configuration from the server.
                         b) Compare the configuration recevied from the server with                             current configuration of the nodes.
                         c) If there is any mis-match take step,required to match th                            -e configuration of the nodes with configuration receive                            -d from the server.
                         d)This means that, its always client that initates communic                           -ation,not the main server.
Example of Pull Based Tool:      Chef and Puppet
